# Homebrew X11
This tap provides formulae with hard dependencies on X11 (which has not been shipped with OS X since 10.7).

To install these you will need to have XQuartz installed with `brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz` or from http://xquartz.macosforge.org.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install homebrew/x11/<formula>`

Or `brew tap homebrew/x11` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-x11/master/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme).
